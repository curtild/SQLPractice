### ðŸ‘‹  Welcome To My Github <a href="https://github.com/curtild/SQLPractice/"><em>SQL Practice</em></a> Repository!

This repository contains my SQL projects. I hope to share what I know, and learn from others. 

#### Why SQL?
To be honest, most database management systems use SQL to access and manipulate data. To analyze data well, we need to know SQL. And, unless NoSQL takes over the market, SQL will be around for the forseeable future. 

#### My SQL Journey
For as long as I can remember, I've always used SQL to manage data. I remember starting with ANSI, then learning T-SQL and working my way over to Oracle PL/SQL, DB2, SQLite and PostgreSQL flavors. To tell the truth, I'm stronger in some flavors of SQL than others. I still have a ways to go to completely master them. It seems I'm still getting used to variations in stored procedures, etc. My preference, believe it or not, is T-SQL. (Yeah, I know...but it is.) My weakest SQL skill is Oracle PL/SQL, so I hope to get up to speed quickly! 

#### More To Come
I will add more of my projects to this repo. I hope there is something of interest to you. I hope to collaborate on future SQL projects, and to publish my NoSQL projects here, as well.
