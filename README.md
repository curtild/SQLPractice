### ðŸ‘‹  Welcome To My Github <a href="https://github.com/curtild/SQLPractice/"><em>SQLPractice</em></a> Repository!

#### What's In This Repository?
#### This repository contains my SQL projects. I hope to share what I know, while learning from others. 

#### Why SQL?
#### To be honest, most database management systems use SQL to access and manipulate data. To analyze data well, we need to know SQL. And, unless NoSQL takes over the market, SQL will be around for the forseeable future. 

#### My SQL Journey
#### For as long as I can remember, I've always used SQL to manage data. I remember starting with ANSI, then learning T-SQL and working my way over to Oracle PL/SQL, DB2, SQLite and PostgreSQL. To tell the truth, I'm stronger in some flavors of SQL than others. I still have a ways to go to completely master them. I'm still getting used to variations in stored procedures, etc. My preference, believe it or not, is T-SQL. (Yeah, I know...but it is.) My weakest SQL skill is Oracle PL/SQL, so I hope to get up to speed quickly! 

#### Challenge Accepted!
#### Some time ago, a dear friend of mine called me and convinced me that we should have a little fun with a SQL challenge. Word had spread of a book with beginner to advanced SQL challenges, so we both bought the Kindle edition. <em>SQL Practice Problems</em> by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik, was somewhat popular around 2016. I don't endorse any particular author, nor attempt to push book sales, but I thought the challenges in this book were sort of fun. So, I've placed my solutions to the book's challenges in this repository. 

#### More To Come
#### I will add more of my projects to this repo as I find the time. I hope there is something of interest to you. I hope to collaborate on future SQL projects, and to publish my NoSQL projects here, as well.
